# DocuBot - Word AI powered plugin

This plugin lets users generate text, translate sentences, and check for spelling mistakes, all within their Word document. It’s designed to help users work faster and more efficiently by streamlining common writing tasks.

This is my first project creating a Microsoft 365 plugin, and I’m excited to see how it can help improve productivity.
